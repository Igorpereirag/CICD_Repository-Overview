# CI/CD Repository - Overview

## What is CI/CD?

**Continuous Integration (CI):** CI is a software development practice where code changes are regularly merged into a shared repository. Each merge triggers automated build and test processes to ensure that changes do not break existing code.

**Continuous Delivery (CD):** Continuous Delivery is an extension of CI, where code is automatically delivered to the production environment after passing through testing stages. This enables faster and more frequent deliveries while maintaining software stability.

## Tools Used

### Jenkins
Jenkins is an open-source CI/CD automation tool that supports a wide variety of plugins. It is highly configurable and can be used to create complex continuous delivery pipelines.

### GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions provides automation directly within GitHub, allowing the creation of custom workflows. It is powerful for CI/CD and seamlessly integrates with GitHub repositories.


### Docker
Docker is a platform that enables packaging, distribution, and execution of applications in containers. This ensures consistent development environments across the software development lifecycle.

### Maven/Gradle
Maven and Gradle are build management tools that automate the process of building and managing dependencies in Java projects.

## Importance of CI/CD

- **Detecting Issues Quickly:** CI helps in quickly detecting integration issues and bugs, facilitating immediate correction.
  
- **Consistent Delivery:** CD ensures that software is delivered consistently and repeatably, avoiding discrepancies between environments.

- **Error Reduction:** Automation reduces the likelihood of human errors when performing repetitive tasks such as building and deploying.

- **Frequent Deliveries:** CI/CD allows for frequent and incremental deliveries, accelerating innovation and response to market changes.

## Repository Structure

- **/src:** Contains the project's source code.
- **/scripts:** Includes support scripts for automation.
- **/docs:** Additional documentation, including information on configuring and using the tools.

## Setting Up the Local Environment

Ensure that the tools are installed locally, and configure credentials/secrets as necessary. Refer to the specific documentation for each tool for detailed guidance.
